One of the most widely held leadership myths I see perpetuated is the concept of "Servant Leadership". Management gurus like Robert Greenleaf (who coined the phrase), Ken Blanchard, John C. Maxwell, and Stephen Covey speak and write at length about the importance of putting others before yourself.  

Being an egoless, selfless leader is a surprisingly popular idea. And it is wrong-headed.

I admire the work and value contributed by the leaders I mentioned, but here is the way I see it... it is important to value talent in others and it is important to help others_when and as it serves your own rational self-interests._

Serving the interests of others regardless of whether their goals are aligned with yours not only undermines your effectiveness, but also steals time and energy from your focus. Worse, it subordinates your happiness and goals to the whims of others.

The idea of "servant leadership" is a contradiction-in-terms. A leader who is a servant...is merely a servant who thinks he is a leader. Nothing more. A servant is a servant.

To make clear the lie within the phrase, simply replace the word "servant" with its more proper term, "slave". Have you heard of "Slave Leadership"? Of course not. You may have heard of a slave who became a leader, but a Leader Slave__

as ridiculous as it sounds.

**A leader's ego**is the most**precious**and**coveted**attribute he or she owns. It is the ego of a great leader that drives him forward, that allows him to trust his own logic and have confidence in himself when others might not. It is also a leader's ego that others value; it is the very thing others look up to and try to emulate in great leaders (even seemingly "egoless" leaders like Gandhi... or Ken Blanchard).

If you want to be a leader, do what other leaders do. Be egotistical enough to throw out the textbook and choose to believe in the power of your own mind to make the right decisions required to lead others.
